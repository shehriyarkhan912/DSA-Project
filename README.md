# DSA-Project : Stack and Queue using Linked List


This repository contains implementations of Stack and Queue data structures using Linked Lists in Python. The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on practice with core data structures while reinforcing concepts of linked lists.

## How to Run the Program

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shehriyarkhan912/DSA-Project
```
2. **Navigate to the directory:**
```bash
   cd DSA-Project
```
3. **Run the Stack program:**
```bash
    stack.py
```
4. **Run the Queue program:**
```bash
   queue.py
```
  
  # Purpose of the Code:
The purpose of this project is to implement Stack and Queue data structures using Linked Lists. This implementation helps in understanding the dynamic nature of linked lists while practicing the operations on these data structures.

### Stack :
A Stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The main operations are:

`push(data)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.

`pop()`: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.

`peek()`: Returns the top element without removing it.

`is_empty()`: Checks if the stack is empty.

`display()`: Displays the elements of the stack.

### Queue :
A Queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. The main operations are:

`enqueue(data)`: Adds an element to the end of the queue.

`dequeue()`: Removes and returns the front element of the queue.

`peek()`: Returns the front element without removing it.

`is_empty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.

`display()`: Displays the elements of the queue.


# Time Complexity

### Stack :
`push(data)`: O(1)

`pop()`: O(1)

`peek()`: O(1)

`is_empty()`: O(1)

`display()`: O(n)

### Queue :
`enqueue(data)`: O(1)

`dequeue()`: O(1)

`peek()`: O(1)

`is_empty()`: O(1)

`display()`: O(n
